# large-grid-react

This project consists in the rendering in React of a table with the name and age of 100,000 random users searched in the API https://random-persons.herokuapp.com/users. The created solution also allows you to filter users by name or age

In the implementation the dependencies "react-window" and "react-virtualized-auto-sizer" were used for rendering the grid and "materialize" for styling the components.

The initial solution is best displayed on large screens, not yet adjusted for mobile devices.

This project can be visited at https://large-grid-react.herokuapp.com/.

New realeses of the project will soon be available. Please contact us if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions for improvement.
